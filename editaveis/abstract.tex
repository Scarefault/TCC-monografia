Production testing has become an important activity in software development process. Not only the market is demanding higher quality, but the average user is demanding reduction of gaps in services and software products. Beyond the relative quality software, should consider the costs related to maintenance. The search and the bug fix is ​​expensive to produce software. In addition, many developers are not motivated to produce tests for their code, which makes the problem worse. Faced with this problem, this paper seeks the implementation of a framework capable of supporting the developer the task of producing unit tests. With this, it will be sought for the production, semiautomatizada of unit tests for common methods for web applications: create, retrieve, update and delete. This framework has the initial target applications in Grails. At the end of the work, the framework will be licensed under GPLv3, giving status of free software. It will be used to implement the C ++ programming language.
