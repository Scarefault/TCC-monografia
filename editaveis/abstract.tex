Test production has become an important activity in software development process.
Not only the market is demanding higher quality, but the average user is demanding
reduction of gaps in services and software products. Beyond the relative quality
software, the costs related to maintenance should be considered. The search and
the bug fix is expensive to software production. In addition, many developers are
not motivated to produce tests for their code, which makes the problem worse.
Faced with this problem, this project sought the implementation of a framework
capable of supporting the developer in the task of producing unit tests. With
this, semi-automated tests will be produced for common methods to web applications:
create, read, update and delete. This framework was to initial target applications
in Grails. Licensed under GPLv3, this \framework has status of free software.
It has been implemented using the C ++ programming language.
