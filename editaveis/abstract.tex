Test production has become an important activity in software development process. Not only the market is demanding higher quality, but the average user is demanding reduction of gaps in services and software products. Beyond the relative quality software, the costs related to maintenance should be considered. The search and the bug fix is expensive to software production. In addition, many developers are not motivated to produce tests for their code, which makes the problem worse. Faced with this problem, this project seeks the implementation of a framework capable of supporting the developer in the task of producing unit tests. With this, semi-automated tests will be produced for common methods to web applications: create, read, update and delete. This framework has the initial target applications in Grails. At the end of the project, the framework will be licensed under GPL, giving it the status of free software. To implement it, the C++ programming language will be used.
